# Website Vulnerability Scanner
# Overview
This script is designed to scan a website for common security vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Open Redirects, and SSL/TLS certificate issues. It also provides information about the server’s geolocation and checks for security-related HTTP headers. The main aim is to assist in identifying potential weaknesses in a website’s security.

# Features
SQL Injection Detection: Detects common SQL injection vulnerabilities.
XSS Vulnerability Detection: Checks for Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.
Open Redirect Vulnerability: Scans for open redirects that could be exploited by attackers.
SSL/TLS Certificate Check: Verifies if the website is using a secure SSL/TLS certificate.
Server Geolocation: Retrieves and displays the server's IP address and geolocation information (city, region, country).
Security Header Check: Reviews the HTTP headers for common security configurations.
Input Field Detection: Scans for HTML input fields and tests them for SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities.

# Requirements
To run the script, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

1) requests
2) beautifulsoup4
3) pyfiglet

# You can install them using pip:

``` pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pyfiglet ```

# How to Use
Clone or download the script to your local machine.

# Run the script:

``` python scanner.py ```

# When prompted

Enter the website URL you want to scan, starting with http:// or https:// (e.g., http://example.com).

The script will:

1) Fetch the website's server location based on the IP address.
2) Check for vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, and Open Redirects.
3) Examine SSL/TLS certificate details (if the site uses HTTPS).
4) Review the HTTP headers for security-related settings.
5) Script Breakdown

# Functions:
get_server_location(url):

-> Retrieves the server's IP address and geolocation (city, region, country) using the ipinfo.io API. Check_ssl_cert(url):

-> Checks if the website uses SSL/TLS (HTTPS) and provides certificate details, such as the issuer and expiration date. Check_http_headers(response):

-> Reviews the HTTP headers for critical security headers like Strict-Transport-Security, X-Content-Type-Options, and X-XSS-Protection. Scan_for_vulnerabilities(page_content):

-> Scans the page for vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, and Open Redirects using regular expressions. Scan_website(url):

->Scans input fields for potential SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities by submitting test payloads.

# Vulnerabilities Pattern:
The script uses basic regular expression patterns to identify the following vulnerabilities:

SQL Injection: Looks for patterns like ' OR 1=1 -- or UNION SELECT.
XSS: Detects <script>alert("XSS")</script> payloads.
Open Redirect: Scans for URLs pointing to an external domain.
